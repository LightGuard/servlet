   <title>Servlet context BeanManager provider</title>
   <para>
      Although discouraged as a general practice, there are circumstances when you need to access the
      <literal>BeanManager</literal> outside of the CDI environment. Seam Servlet includes a provider that retrieves the
      <literal>BeanManager</literal> from the Servlet context as an alternative to performing a JNDI lookup to resolve
      it, the standard lookup mechanism in JSR-299. The Servlet module uses it's own Servlet-to-CDI event bridge to
      bind the <literal>BeanManager</literal> to the Servlet context when the application is initialized.

      provider</ulink> chapter of the Weld Extensions reference guide for information on how to leverage the Servlet
      context provider to access the <literal>BeanManager</literal> from outside the CDI environment.
