   <title>Servlet Context attribute BeanManager provider</title>
   <para>
      Although discouraged as a general practice, there are circumstances access to the <literal>BeanManager</literal>
      is required outside of the CDI context. Seam Servlet includes a provider that retrieves the
      <literal>BeanManager</literal> from the Servlet context attribute named
      <literal>javax.enterprise.inject.spi.BeanManager</literal>, an alternative to the standard JNDI lookup mechanism
      defined in the JSR-299 specification. The Servlet module also handles binding the <literal>BeanManager</literal>
      to this attribute when the application is initialized. The work is performed in a CDI observer that is notified by
      the Servlet-CDI bridge provided by this very module.

      context provider to access the <literal>BeanManager</literal> from outside the CDI environment.
