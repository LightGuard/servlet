      The goal of Seam Servlet is to provide portable enhancements to the Servlet API. Features include producers for
      implicit Servlet objects and HTTP request state, propogating Servlet events to the CDI event bus, passing uncaught
      exceptions to the Seam Catch handler chain and binding the BeanManager to a Servlet context attribute for
      convenient access.
